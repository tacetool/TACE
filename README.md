# TACE



## Description

Taint Assisted Concolic Execution (TACE) utilizes the concept of taint in symbolic execution to identify all sets of dependent symbols. TACE can evaluate a subset of these sets with a significantly reduced testing effort by concretizing some symbols from selected subsets. The remaining subsets are explored with symbolic values. TACE optimizes symbolic constraints, facilitating a streamlined symbolic execution process that emphasizes the critical aspects of program behavior. Doing so contributes to a more practical and scalable approach for identifying vulnerabilities, generating comprehensive test suites, and aiding software security analysis. This paper explores TACE's capabilities, illustrating how it leverages constraint debloating to advance symbolic execution techniques and significantly improve software analysis practices.


## Architecture

The above figure illustrates the hybrid fuzzing architecture of TACE. The input source project is compiled with TACE and AFL-Clang to generate a TACE-instrumented binary and an AFL-instrumented binary, respectively. As TACE uses the underlying architecture of SymCC, it uses \textit{SymCChelper} to generate inputs from the TACE-instrumented binary. AFL~\cite{afl} generates the initial seed for the AFL-instrumented binary. The AFL-instrumented binary is fuzzed to explore unique crashes and generate new inputs. The seeds generated by \textit{SymCChelper} are only retained if they explore previously unseen paths. The collected seeds are used to fuzz the input program and generate new seeds.



## How to build
This is a binary-only symbolic/concolic executor based on QEMU, SymCC, and TACE. 
To understand the build steps, please check (Dockefile)[Dockefile]. It is considered a self-documented step.
The build happens through several stages of building foundations where TACE patches 
are applied to required components.

To build a test case, it is enough to do the following:

> Please install docker depending on the system you use.

```
docker build -t tace -f Dockefile .
docker run -it --rm tace /bin/bash
```

> This will build the required docker container and environment, which is ready to go for development.
>
> All necessary patches are applied. Updating the Dockerfile to use other source repos is possible.

## How to run a basic example

A basic example program that represents an approach where bloating of symbolic deps happens due to deps between branches.

```cpp 
//symbex2.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char *file = argv[1];
    char str[2000];//tainted buffer
    int fsize;
    int check=0, i;
    FILE *fp = fopen(file, "r");
    fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END); // seek to end of file
    fsize = ftell(fp); // get current file pointer
    fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_SET); // seek back to beginning of file
	if(fsize<40 || fsize>1999)
		return -1;
    fread(str, sizeof(char), fsize, (FILE*)fp);
    for(i=0;i<(fsize-6);i++)
    {
      if((str[i]+str[i+1])<(str[i+3]+str[i+4]+str[i+5]))
	check++;
    }
	// push constraint from loop
	if(check<1)
	{
		printf("too many large chars. Exiting!\n");
		return -1;
	}
    if(str[7] + str[5] == 'R')
    {
        printf("branch 1\n");
        if(str[18] + str[19] == 'b')
        {
            //some code
            printf("branch 2\n");
            if(str[2] + str[4] == 'X')
                {
                    printf("unrelated branch 1\n");
                }
            if(str[4] + str[8] == 'X')
                {
                    printf("unrelated branch 2\n");
                }
            if(str[15] + str[18] == 'U')
            {
                printf("branch 3\n");
                if(str[5] + str[9] == 'X')
                {
                    printf("unrelated branch 3\n");
                }
                if(str[11] + str[24] == 'X')
                {
                    printf("unrelated branch 4\n");
                }
                if(str[15] + str[14] == 'g')
                {
                    printf("vulnerable branch 4\n");
                    //vulnerable_function(&str[30]);
                    abort();
                }
                else
                    printf("branch 5\n");
             }
            else
              printf("branch 6\n");
        }
    }
    printf("branch 0\n");
 	return 0;
 }

```

Once docker is run, WORKDIR is setup for `/tmp` folder.
You might find there the source above, created folder for the cases and garbage.
By default backend handles STDIN input, but to specify a file that should be treated as symbolic, use  `SYMCC_INPUT_FILE` variable. If you want to change output folder location, use `SYMCC_OUTPUT_DIR` variable. Check below

To run simple case(workdir=/tmp):

```
cc -O2 sanjay1_loop.c -o test.elf
echo 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA' > input
SYMCC_INPUT_FILE=/tmp/input SYMCC_OUTPUT_FOLDER=/tmp/output taceqemu /tmp/test.elf /tmp/input
```

Example of output:
